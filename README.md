## Typological analysis (Bachelor thesis)

Development of a QGIS C++ plugin with an archaeological database as input for typological analysis. 

My bachelor thesis is written in German. The translated title is "Extension of a GIS for the investigation of typological development using the example of Roman swords".

Combining my two study subjects Archaeology and Information processing, the goal of the thesis was to write a C++ plugin for the geographical information system software QGIS which helps display and investigate archaeological data to make information more easily accessible to the user.
