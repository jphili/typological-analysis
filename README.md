## Typological analysis (Bachelor thesis)

My bachelor thesis is written in German. The translated title is "Extension of a GIS for the investigation of typological development using the example of Roman swords".

Combining my two study subjects Archaeology and Information processing, the goal of the thesis was to write a C++ plugin for the geographical information system software QGIS which helps display and investigate archaeological data to make information more easily accessible to the user. 

The chronological classification of artifacts based on their design is called typology and was first introduced by the Swedish prehistorian Oscar Montelius. In 1903, he published a book called "Die Methode" in Germany. His method enabled archaeologists to formulate relative chronologies by comparing archaeological objects.

Roman short (gladii) and long swords (spathae) can be categorized by specific features such as blade, handle, etc into a typology as well. Roman sword finds are treated in detail in the two-part monograph "Studien zur römischen Schwertbewaffnung in der Kaiserzeit" written by Christian Miks (2007). It formed the base for creating the database used in this thesis. The database contained over 250 sword finds.
